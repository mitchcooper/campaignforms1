## List and Sell Vendor Acknowledgement

The vendor advises that that they have made the choice not to expose the property to marketing and promotional campaign and that they have accepted the offer on this agreement as an 'off market' sale.

The vendor acknowledges that they have made that decision after having been informed by the agency that exposing the property through a marketing and promotion campaign has the potential to obtain the best possible price for the property and that it was recommended to them before the acceptance of this offer that they seek their own independent legal advice and the advice of a registered valuer.

The vendor further acknowledges that they have been advised, and that they accept, that the purchaser may cross-lease, subdivide, renovate, or immediately place the property back on the market either through an agency or privately and by doing so may achieve a higher price than the offer on this agreement.
